## 5 Topics I know very well
#### 
* **Javasccript Variables** - knowing how to declare variables using let vs var vs const was very straightforward for me because it mostly just relied on scope and data type. These were topics we already learned in grade 8 and we also had a brief overview of data types in grade 7.

* **Comparison Operators** - this is a topic I know very well because it's applicable and used in other subjects such as math. Admittedly I did get confused on how to use === at the start but it's also why I'm so familiar with the topic now because i kept on revising it until I got the use of ===.

* **While and do while loops** - I know these topics very well because we had one of the best exercises in class on loops. But more importantly I don't always get "for loops" especially for loops within for loops so I had to find different styles of loops to work with.

* **Break and Continue Statements** - I know these topics very well because we had alot of examples on how they were applied in class. They're also very straightforward on when t%o use them in loops.

* **Generating Output** - this is a topic I know very well because we've been generating outputs since grade 7 and grade 9 just brings new methods to do it. I also tried to study this topic well because it's almost like a very basic skill we need in coding for example errors in codes are usually caught when the output is wrong but how would you identify a wrong output if there is none at all.

## 5 Topics I need further practice/discussion on
#### 
* **For loops** – I understand the structure and purpose of for loops in repeating tasks, and I can explain how they work conceptually. However, I need more practice to apply them smoothly in solving different types of problems. I think I just need more practice in familiarizing myself with what happens each time the loop reoccurs since I mostly get lost in that part.

* **Using input statements in functions** – I know how input statements can be placed inside functions and can describe their role. Still, I need practice to confidently implement them in different function-based programs. At times it's just a matter of remembering how to call input statements to be used in the function.

* **Number Properties**: Number methods – I can explain what number methods are used for, such  as checking even/odd numders. But sometimes I still get confused on what the output will be when transforming numbers into different datatypes.

* **Nested loops** – (specifically with for loops) I can describe how nested loops work by running one loop inside another. But I need more practice in applying them efficientlyy. Sometimes i just get overwhelemd because I understand how the loopworks at 1 level but then I lose track of everything when talking about the loops happening simultaeneously.

* **Event handlers** – I can describe how event handlers respond to specific user actions, like clicks or key presses, and why they’re important in interactive programs. However, I need more practice in writing and applying them correctly in different coding situations.

## Plan of Action
####
My plan of action to understand the topics further is to dedicate regular practice time by solving short coding problems for each concept, on educational websites such as codechef. I will also review example codes and run them to see how they work, then try modifying them to strengthen my understanding on different possible occurences that may be needed in different codes. I also plan to watch tutorials or read reference materials when I get stuck. Most importantly i wish to dedicate more time to attend consultations since my classmates have deemed them helpful.

## Activities
####
**Effective**
* The activity where we experimented with push and pop in functions using fruits as examples. This was helpful because it's a small activity that actually helped me feel abit more confident when it came to functions and it gave me the motivation to completely give up on them.
* The tv channel activity because even if it was very simplified, it gave us an example of what daily activities actually have programming behind the scenes and it gave us the chance to view the world from a programmer's persepctive which motivated us to learn.

**Not effective**
* Long lectures without activities in between. This isn't necessarily a specific activity but it is something that occurs in class. While I do learn from long lectures, I believe it will help us learn more efficiently if we have small practice exercises after we learn each concept so we don't get information overload then attempt to apply it all in one long task
* Spending time decorating outputs and having long codes in style.css. Please don't get me wrong, I actually really enjoy decorating our outputs since its like "not coding- but coding". Still, I often wonder if the time would be better used to provide more coding problems for us to solve so we deepen our understanding on the topic. Perhaps in tasks outside of class such as graded activities we could design our outputs but Ithink we can minimize it in class expecially since we're very pressed for time.
