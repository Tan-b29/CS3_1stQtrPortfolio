      <h2 style="text-align:left;">Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)</li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar (165 g), packed</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour (155 g)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup of chocolate chips or chunks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula. (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) from the edges.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
      </ol>
